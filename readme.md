## Semantic parser
Writing a [semantic](https://github.com/github/semantic) parser for Elm will hopefully help getting github to be much smarter about Elm code in the future.

More info can be found here: [Adding new languages](https://github.com/github/semantic/blob/master/docs/adding-new-languages.md)

What's needed: tree sitter, haskell

Possible mentor: TBD
